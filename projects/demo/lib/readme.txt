Here should be all library elements which are used in the project.
But because the development is in an very eary state, the design of the library elements is not yet finished.
This would mean that we have always to update the library elements in two directories (library and project's library).
Instead, temporarly we use the normal library also as the project's library. The "path redirection" is hardcoded in the source files.
